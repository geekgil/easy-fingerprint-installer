## 🔍 The Problem

Fingerprint readers generally don't have official drivers on Linux. The open-source `python-validity` solution works as a substitute, but manual installation is complex and prone to errors that cause system freezes.

### ⚠️ Common Symptoms (Without This Script)

- `sudo` takes 10-30 seconds to respond when there are issues with the fingerprint detection system
- Login screen freezes waiting for the fingerprint reader
- In logs: `"The service is suspended, delay the call"`
- After manual installation: `USBTimeoutError` or `message type 15` errors

### 🔬 Root Cause

The Linux kernel uses **USB autosuspend** for power saving. The fingerprint reader doesn't wake up correctly after suspension, getting stuck in a "zombie" state and freezing authentication operations.

---

## ✨ The Solution

This script implements a **robust, phased installation with protections** that:

✅ Automatically detects your fingerprint reader  
✅ Configures udev rules to disable USB autosuspend on the device  
✅ Installs necessary packages from the official PPA  
✅ **Detects when reboot is necessary** (firmware loading)  
✅ **Persistent state system** - resumes after reboot  
✅ **Interactive menu** to enroll multiple fingers  
✅ Optional PAM activation (login/sudo)  
✅ Complete and clean uninstall script  

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation in 3 Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/geekgil/easy-fingerprint-installer.git
cd easy-fingerprint-installer

# 2. Run the installer
chmod +x install-fingerprint.sh
./install-fingerprint.sh

# 3. If it asks for reboot, restart and run again
# The script automatically resumes from where it stopped!
```

## 📦 Compatibility

### Tested Operating Systems

- ✅ Pop!_OS 22.04+
- ✅ Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (Jammy) (should work)
- ✅ Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Noble) (should work)
- 🔶 Linux Mint 21+ or other Ubuntu derivatives (may work)

### Supported Devices

This installer works with **any laptop** equipped with a **Synaptics/Validity** fingerprint reader (USB ID `06cb:xxxx`).

| Model | USB ID | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Synaptics Metallica MIS Touch | `06cb:009a` | ✅ Tested |
| Other Synaptics models | `06cb:xxxx` | 🔶 Should work |

**Tested on:** Lenovo ThinkPad T480

**Compatible with:** Dell, HP, Lenovo (ThinkPad, IdeaPad), Asus, and other laptops with Synaptics/Validity sensors

> 💡 **Tip:** Check if your reader is compatible with `lsusb | grep 06cb`

---

## 📘 Detailed Usage

### Complete Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/geekgil/easy-fingerprint-installer.git
cd easy-fingerprint-installer

# 2. Make scripts executable
chmod +x *.sh

# 3. Run the installer
./install-fingerprint.sh
```

The script executes **7 phases**:

1. **Pre-Installation Checks** - Detects reader and configures repository
2. **Power Configuration** - Creates anti-freeze udev rule
3. **Package Installation** - Installs python-validity + open-fprintd
4. **Initialization and Verification** - Tests services and detects if reboot is needed
5. **Fingerprint Enrollment** - Interactive menu to enroll fingers
6. **Verification Test** - Validates that the reader recognizes your fingerprint
7. **System Activation** - (Optional) Integrates with login/sudo via PAM

### If the Script Asks for Reboot

```bash
# The script detected that firmware needs to be loaded
# Simply restart:
sudo reboot

# After restarting, run again:
./install-fingerprint.sh

# ✨ It will automatically continue from fingerprint enrollment (Phase 5)!
```

### Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall-fingerprint.sh
```

Completely removes:
- ✅ Installed packages
- ✅ Udev rules
- ✅ PAM configuration
- ✅ State files
- ✅ Enrolled fingerprints

---

## 🔧 Useful Commands

After successful installation:

### Managing Fingerprints

```bash
# Manually enroll new finger
fprintd-enroll -f right-thumb

# Verify if it recognizes your fingerprint
fprintd-verify

# List enrolled fingers
fprintd-list $USER

# Delete all fingerprints
fprintd-delete $USER
```

**Available finger names:**
- **Right Hand:** `right-thumb`, `right-index-finger`, `right-middle-finger`, `right-ring-finger`, `right-little-finger`
- **Left Hand:** `left-thumb`, `left-index-finger`, `left-middle-finger`, `left-ring-finger`, `left-little-finger`

### Monitoring System

```bash
# View service status
systemctl status python3-validity

# Monitor logs in real-time
journalctl -u python3-validity -f

# Check USB power configuration
cat /etc/udev/rules.d/99-fingerprint-power.rules
```

### Configure PAM (Login/Sudo)

```bash
# Enable/disable fingerprint authentication
sudo pam-auth-update

# Check if PAM is configured
grep pam_fprintd /etc/pam.d/common-auth
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: `sudo` is still slow

**Cause:** PAM configured with fingerprint, but service doesn't respond quickly

**Solution:**
```bash
# Temporarily disable fingerprint authentication
sudo pam-auth-update
# → Uncheck "Fingerprint authentication"
```

### Problem: Service doesn't start

**Symptoms:**
```
[ERROR] python3-validity service failed to start
```

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Check the logs
sudo journalctl -u python3-validity --since "5 minutes ago"

# 2. If you see "message type" or "USBTimeoutError" → Needs reboot
sudo reboot

# 3. Try resetting the USB device
sudo systemctl restart python3-validity
```

### Problem: "No devices available"

**Solution:**
```bash
# 1. Confirm that the reader is detected
lsusb | grep 06cb

# 2. If it appears, probably needs reboot
sudo reboot

# 3. Run the installer again
./install-fingerprint.sh
```

### Problem: Script doesn't resume after reboot

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check the state file
cat ~/.fingerprint_install_state

# If it shows a phase, run the script again
./install-fingerprint.sh

# If you want to start from scratch, delete the state
rm ~/.fingerprint_install_state ~/.fingerprint_*
./install-fingerprint.sh
```

### Problem: fprintd-enroll not found

**Cause:** Packages were uninstalled but state file persists

**Solution:**
```bash
# The script automatically detects and reinstalls
./install-fingerprint.sh

# Or force manual cleanup:
rm ~/.fingerprint_install_state
./install-fingerprint.sh
```
